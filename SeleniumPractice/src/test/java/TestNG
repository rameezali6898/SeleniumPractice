If u use maven project, we add dependencies. Dependency means library or jar file
java project means, we add jar files.   
Plugin means software or tool
To download testNG dependency from maven repository
To download testng plugin from help-->eclipse marketplace-->search testng and install it.
TestNG mainly used for sequential and parallel execution purpose
In testNG we cant use main method with static and string arr[]
In testng all methods are run by ascii based
If we used priority and dependson at the same time, testNG gives high priority to dependsOn.
invocationCount is the term used to perform no of times the testcase run
Incase run the medhod which its dependsOn method is fail means we can use "alwaysRun=true".
if u skip any method, we can use "enabled=false"
we use enable and alwaysrun in same method, the first priority is enable.
if the method is wrong but u need to pass the test means u can use expectedExceptions={someexception u put} it will pass
include and exclude both are used in a group means exclude is high priority

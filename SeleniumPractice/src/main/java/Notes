List is a interface
In interface the function doesnt have body like, public void aadhar(); In interface all functions are public. We cant create object for interface. We can implement multiple interface
JDK 1.8 its possible for create body for the function in the interface, like default,static access modifier use
Boolean default value false
Each and every class extends a object
In inheritance multilevel is possible, but multiple is not possible
In Abstract class we cant create object
List allows duplicate and maintain the order of insertion and also case sensitive
Set is also an interface. it cannot maintain order and it doesn't allow duplicate
Tree set changed the order into alphabetic
LinkedHashSet maintain the insertion order
